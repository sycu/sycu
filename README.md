## Senior PHP Developer
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sycu. I'm a senior backend developer from WrocÅ‚aw. I'm interested in competitive programming (mostly [~~CodeFights~~ CodeSignal](https://app.codesignal.com/profile/sycu), Codewars, SPOJ), automating things and not finishing my private projects. Apart from programming, I love motorcycles, photography and electronics.
